Review:

Excellent when you don't have control over the HTML  -- CMS!!!

:first-child  -  select first child of a parent
:last-child  -  select last child of a parent
:only-child  -  target elements with no siblings
:empty  -  targets elements with no children or content

Substring matching attribute selectors  -  match specific pieces of an attributes value
 ^ tells browser to match a piece of code that's at the beginning of an attributes value
 $ matches a piece at the end of an attributes value
 * matches any part of an attributes value

:checked  -  targets the checked state of a radio button or checkbox
:disabled -- targets disabled text fields

:nth-child()  --  (argument)
:nth-child(an+b)  --  b = first element to select (number),   a = cycle of elements to select

:nth-of-type()
:nth-last-of-type()    --  number of element from the bottom
